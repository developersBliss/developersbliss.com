                <p><a href="http://www.developersbliss.com">developersBliss.com</a> was originally created by <a href="andrew.php">Andrew Larsson</a> and <a href="daniel.php">Daniel James</a> to be a gaming website for our friends at school. At its peak, this was a relatively popular website, but the glory days are long gone. Now this serves as a sort of home base, a small part of the Internet that we can call our own. We'll be using this site to post projects that we've finished or are working on. If you need to get in-touch with us for whatever reason, feel free to visit our individual pages or use the <a href="contact.php">site contact form.</a></p>
